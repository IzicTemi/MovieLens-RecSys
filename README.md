# Matrix Factorization for Recommender Systems: A MovieLens Case Study

This study investigates the use of matrix factorization in building a movie recommendation system using the MovieLens 25M dataset. Matrix factorization techniques are employed to decompose the user-item interaction matrix into latent factors, which help predict user preferences and recommend movies accurately. The system integrates user and item biases to improve the recommendation quality, addressing the inherent sparsity and variability in user ratings. Regularization parameters are fine-tuned to prevent overfitting and enhance the model's generalization capabilities. Evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, showing the ability of the model to give personalized recommendations from ratings only without any contextual understanding.
